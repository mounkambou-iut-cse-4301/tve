            <h3 style="color:#004B49"><b>Welcome to the Department of CSE</b> </h3>
            <p>We are delighted to welcome you to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the
                Islamic University of Technology (IUT). The Department’s long and decorated history is a story of
                relentless refinement and a never-ending pursuit of academic excellence at the highest level. The
                department was created with a vision to create a community of scholars and engineers who are
                equipped with the requisite knowledge and expertise to make meaningful contributions across the many
                different disciplines within Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
            <p>
                The department has continued to reinvent itself throughout the years. Since its inception, the
                department has sought to develop a highly qualified pool of faculty members who are capable of
                guiding students through the many challenges and exciting opportunities inherent in such a
                fast-changing academic discipline. The department also strives to offer the state of the art in
                terms of facilities, laboratories, and resources to students with a view to creating more and more
                possibilities for research and effective learning. Furthermore, the department goes out of its way
                to arrange workshops, seminars, conferences, and internship programs, to assist in the holistic
                development of our students. We also seek to collaborate with the industry and other universities,
                pooling our expertise together to create meaningful and impactful work.
            </p>
            <p> We aim to be a premier research hub, and for the attainment of this goal, we have outlined five
                different research areas with dedicated labs and associated resources. This includes The Systems and
                Software Lab (SSL), the Computer Vision Lab (CVLab), the Network and Data Analysis Group (NDAG), the
                Network Research Group, and the Bioinformatics and Data Mining Research Group (BDMRG). These are
                active groups that enjoy vibrant participation from both us, the faculty at the CSE department, and
                also the students who get to explore a unique opportunity to experience research.</p>
            <p>
                This is but a tiny glimpse of what the CSE department has to offer. We implore you to delve into our
                website and explore in detail the many activities and achievements and the dynamic culture of this
                department. Feel free to contact us for any further information. Your feedback is highly
                appreciated.</p>
